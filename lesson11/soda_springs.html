      <h2>Smart Move Bob</h2>
      <img id='article-img' src="images/heros/angry_gamer.jpg" alt="Angry gamer playing on computer.">
      <p>Once upon a time, there was this guy named Bob, he had no idea what he is doing. You can see his face full of pain. He used a highly specialized headset that enables him to cheat but by cheating, he experiences the pain. The things that enables him to cheat are knowing the location of other players, shoot bazooka instead of bullets. You know, all that jazz. Then suddenly, the blue light glows as mom shouted at Alexa to turn on the lights to try and get Bob's attention. Bob is so into the game that he never saw the blue glow behind him. He goes to McDonald for master college. They taught him all the tricks of deep frying french fries. By learning how to do this, he can produce some as he plays the game. What a legend. He told me, "You guys are still reading this? Wow go outside sheesh." I was shocked and angry that he broke the fourth wall. I went home and cried for hours on end. I finally composed myself and continue writing the story of Bob. He was born with perfect teeth but they fell out and now he has fake bionic teeth. He has 127 siblings and he is the youngest, this explains why he has a lot of nice things such as nice face, nice shirt, nice wall pictures, nice headset, nice nose, nice hands, nice keyboard, and nice mouse. His 127 siblings pays him money. He will never work again because he does Twitch where he goes twitching in gaming and people pay him for twitching. Like an actual twitching and shaking, people felt sorry for him. This is because he is cheating and in pain. As such it causes him to twitch all the time. Pun intented. He never knew his father because his father went out to war against the moon. His father died trying to save humanity and no one knew about it except his father and me. And now you know about this hidden war. The moon is so huge and ridiculus that it's fake. Bravo.</p>
